## What Gideon can do (so far) ##

* Ask Gideon about General Knowledge. For Example, 'Who is Taylor Swift?', 'What is the capital of Poland?', 'Who is in Maroon 5?'

* Give Gideon a command similar to 'Quiz me on {topic}', and she will quiz you. If you want Gideon to repeat something, say 'interrupt', and then 'Can you say that again?'. She will gladly comply. To stop quizzing, simply say 'stop quizzing'.

* Ask Gideon about the weather, for example, 'What is the weather like in Austin?'

* Ask Gideon to tell you a joke (These are usually pretty cringy)

* Make small talk

* Play Music
