## Documentation ##

__Prerequisites__:
Look through all the python files for libraries you don't have. Most of them except for quizlet are downloadable through pip.

__Usage__:
Just run logicControl.py! The default input mode is "input", in which you receive a prompt (>), which you press enter on to dictate voice commands. Have fun! 

## Using Quizlet: ##
Give Gideon a command similar to "Quiz me on {topic}", and he will quiz you. If you want Gideon to repeat something, say "interrupt", and then "can you say that again?". He will gladly comply.
